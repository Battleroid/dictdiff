dictdiff
========

Python diff / merge basic dictionaries / lists

A simple library to record changes between two simple objects and merge the changes into base object to get the changed object.
Perfect if you want to store what was changed (e.g. by storing a JSON of the resulting object) and then at a later time apply the changes back to auto-generated base data.
